# Simulating_a_cricket_stadium
The cricket season is about to start and the stadium administration has been receiving poor reviews due to their long waiting time during entry.
It is known from their credible resources that the spectators are willing to wait for at most 20 minutes from standing in line for purchasing their tickets to getting onto their seats.
There are 3 types of counters that the audience has to go through:
Ticket Counter
Food and beverage counter
Security check counter
From the past data the following interpretations can be made:-
To purchase Tickets it takes between 1 to 7 minutes.
To purchase the food items it takes between 3 to 15 minutes. It is also found that only 50% people prefer to buy food.
The security check takes around 15 seconds.
Constraints: The Stadium admin has a limited budget, so they want to hire as few people as possible
